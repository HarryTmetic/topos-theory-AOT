# A topos-theoretic formalization of Abstract Object Theory
*(Pre-print repository)*

---

## 1  Quick description

This pre-print gives what appears to be the **first categorical semantics** of Edward Zalta’s *Abstract Object Theory (AOT)*.  
Using the presheaf topos 

$$
\mathcal{Z} = [\mathbf{C}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]
$$

where $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Set}^{\mathbf{P}}$.

We  

1. model **dual predication** (encoding vs exemplification) via internal vs global
   truth,  
2. **derive Zalta’s comprehension principle** from the subobject classifier
   (instead of postulating it),  
3. show that *impossible* and *fictional* objects (e.g. the “round square” or
   Sherlock Holmes) are consistent subobjects with no global elements, and  
4. outline applications to modal ontological arguments.

A short, non-technical overview is in §1 of the paper.
